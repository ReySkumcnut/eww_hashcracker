Eww was made by and is still maintained by Rey S.

Eww is a super simple hashcracker that i made to learn C, while learning about windows security and tools like John the Ripper and hashcat.
I was 12, it 7th grade when i was really close to getting the admin password for my school laptop, just for fun.
I met some 8 graders, who were trying to install a virtual machine without admin rights. I told them everything about my work so far. They liked it.
On the day after, i decided that i wanted to learn C a bit more. Deeply inspired by mimikatz, i made eww. Writing eww made me reinvent rainbow tables and spend days talking to
chatgpt. Made the first version on the same day, with it being basically CTRL + H in a txt document, gradually improving everything with every version.
